# Welcome to Advent of code 2018 - The many languages challange!

Link: https://adventofcode.com/2018

In this repo we try to solve the daily tasks in as many languages as possible. Pick a language which does not have a solution yet and solve it.

Contributing:
* To contribute make a pull request with your solution.
* Name your pull-request like this example 'day03-golang'
* Fork repo or ask to join as contributor

Rules:
* One file per language per day.
* Every solution-file is named 'main' (e.g main.py, main.go, main.ru, main.js, main.cs, ....)
* You may look at each others solution, or you can do it on your own. Pick your challange.
