### General
* There are no deadlines (You don't have to submit day01 on 01. desember 2018)
* You may look at other's solutions, or you can do it on your own. Pick your challange.

### Contributing
* To contribute make a pull request with your solution.
* Name your pull-request like this example 'day03-golang'
* Fork repo or ask to join as contributor
* Every solution-file is named 'main' (e.g main.py, main.go, main.ru, main.js, main.cs, ....)

### Input
* Each program should expect the input as a list of command-line arguments:
* Every folder contains a `input`-file with testdata you can use.
```
$ ./day01/main $(cat day01/input)
```
...expands to
```
$ ./day01/main +10 -3 -17 +4 +23 +16 -7 -30 +29 -19 +18 -3 ...
```

### Output

Each program's output(stdout) is expected to match the `output`-file of each folder:
```
$ day01/main $(cat day01/input)
408
55250
```
.. matches `day01/output`
```
408
55250
```
* Note: Everyone receives unique input-data on adventofcode.com. The correct answer in this repo will not be the correct answer on your adventofcode.com user. Use your own input-data to score points there.
