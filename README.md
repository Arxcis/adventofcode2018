In this repo we try to solve the daily tasks in as many languages as possible.

Pick a language which does not have a solution yet and solve it.

To contribute make a pull request with your solution.

Rules:
* One file per language per day.
* Every solution-file is named 'main' (e.g main.py, main.go, main.ru, main.js, main.cs, ....)
