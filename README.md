### General
* There are no deadlines (You don't have to submit day01 on 01. desember 2018)
* You may look at other's solutions, or you can do it on your own. Pick your challange.

### Contributing
* To contribute make a pull request with your solution.
* Name your pull-request like this example 'day03-golang'
* Fork repo or ask to join as contributor
* Every solution-file is named 'main' (e.g main.py, main.go, main.ru, main.js, main.cs, ....)

**Input**

Every folder contains a `input`-file. Expand the data of this file to program arguments using the unix `cat` command.
```
$ go run main.go $(cat input)
```
...expands to
```
$ go run main.go +10 -3 -17 +4 +23 +16 -7 -30 +29 -19 +18 -3 ...
```

**Output**

 `part1` or `part2` followed by a space and your answer.
```
$ go run main.go $(cat input)
part1 408
part2 55250
```
